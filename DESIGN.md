DM Sans handles all body text, UI labels, and navigation at weights 400, 500, and 600. The typography system favors bold, large titles with generous line heights to feel open and scannable. Letter-spacing is kept at default or slightly loose (0.01em) for smaller text to maintain readability.

## Elevation
Shadow strategy is subtle and warm, using slightly tinted shadows to feel less cold than pure black. Level 1 (0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.08), 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)) is used for cards and listing tiles. Level 2 (0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.08), 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)) is used for modals, date pickers, and dropdown menus. Level 3 (0 6px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.12), 0 16px 40px rgba(0,0,0,0.16)) is reserved for the sticky booking bar and full-screen overlays. On hover, cards transition from Level 1 to Level 2 with a 200ms ease transition.

- Do use #222222 as the dominant text color for a warm, non-harsh reading experience
- Don't use pure black (#000000) for text — it feels too cold for this system

- Don't use sharp corners — minimum 4px border-radius on all interactive elements
- Do provide generous touch targets (48px minimum) for all booking-critical actions
- Don't hide pricing — always show cost prominently with DM Sans weight 700
